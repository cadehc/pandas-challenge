Three Observable Trends:
	1. In the purchase analysis by gender, I found that males were more likely to make more than one in-game purchase,
		but females spent more money per purchase, on average. However, most people in general only made one
		in-game purchase. There were a total of 780 purchases between 576 players. The game had a total revenue of 
		$2,379.77 from all in-game purchases, with an average of $3.05 spent per purchase.
	
	2. Based on total in-game purchases, 67% of this game's player base consists of players between the ages of 16-25.
		Nearly 42% of purchases came from the 21-25 age group, with 25% coming from the 16-20 age group. 
		All top 5 spenders were males from ages 20 to 26.
	
	3. The most popular in-game item, Final Critic, was purchased by 13 different players from multiple age groups; 
		the youngest purchaser is 7 years old, and the oldest is 39. Two of the top 5 most popular items, Final Critic
		and Persuasion, had two different listed prices. This is likely due to the possibility of the items being 
		on sale at one point. However, most purchasers did not pick up these items at the lower price, so this did 
		not seem to affect the popularity or purchase frequency of the items. All top 5 most popular items were 
		also the top 5 most profitable due to their purchase counts. The only exception is Persuasion, which is
		listed as fourth most popular but fifth most profitable. This is likely due to it's low price, which dropped
		it to fifth on the most profitable list despite it's 9 purchases (same purchase count as Nirvana 
		and Extraction).
